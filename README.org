* Description :unfold:

*elfeed-curate* is an add-on for [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]], an RSS reader for
Emacs.

The purpose of this package is to add the additional functionality needed to
curate RSS feeds. It provides the capability to annotate feed entries and to
publish entries grouped by their subject categories. =elfeed-curate= uses the
available =elfeed= search functionality for marking, tagging, and filtering of
feed entries. The new functions available to support the curation workflow are:

*** Entry annotation
- =elfeed-curate-edit-entry-annoation= (=a= key) adds the ability to create and
  edit annotation text to an entry. Annotations can have org mode formatting and
  are saved in the =elfeed= database. This function works in both search and
  show mode.

  When an annotation is added a custom tag (=elfeed-curate-annotation-tag=,
  default is =ann=) is also added to the entry. This shows which entries have
  annotations in the search window and can also be used as a filter (=s +ann=).
*** Entry selection
- =elfeed-curate-toggle-star= (=m= key) is a convenience function that allows
  starring entries from the show buffer. See [[https://pragmaticemacs.wordpress.com/2016/09/16/star-and-unstar-articles-in-elfeed/][Star and unstar articles in elfeed]].
  =elfeed-curate-star-tag= (default is =star=) can be used to change the tag
  name.
*** Publication (Exporting)
- =elfeed-curate-export-entries= (=x= key) exports entries in the
  =*elfeed-search*= buffer to the desired publication format (see
  =elfeed-curate-org-export-backend=). The newly generated file is also opened
  with the associated application (e.g. a browser for HTML). Exporting directly
  to Hugo (Markdown plus Front matter) is also supported.

  The subject categories are based on the entry tag names (see details below).
*** Utilities
- Use =M-x elfeed-curate-reconcile-annotations= to ensure all database entries
  have the correct annotation tags.

* Curation Workflow
My preferred workflow is as follows:
1. If an entry has *content of interest*, =star= (=m= key) it and add annotation
   (=a= key) if desired.
2. Select all starred entries (=s +star=) and export them (=x= key). This can be
   repeated as often as is needed to ensure that the exported content is to your
   liking.
3. Publish exported content.
4. (optional) Previously published entries can be tracked by tagging all starred
   entries with a new date-based publication tag (e.g. =+ pub_DDMMYY=).
5. Remove all of the star tags (=m= key or =- star=).

That's it. The Elfeed filtering capabilities can provide many other entry
selection criteria (e.g. time-based), but so far I've found that specifically
tagging selected entries /independent/ of their subject matter to be simple and
efficient.

This is the elfeed search window showing the starred entries to be exported. The entries with annotations (=ann=) are highlighted.

  The exported content (as HTML here) shows how entries are grouped (based on tag name) and some annotation examples.
  The same content exported to Hugo is here: [[https://bobonmedicaldevicesoftware.com/coi/posts/21-sep-2023-export/][21-Sep-2023 Content of Interest]].

* Prerequisites

This package only depends on =org= and =elfeed= being installed.

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =elfeed-curate.el=, put it in
your =load-path= and =require= it.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package elfeed-curate
  :ensure
  :after elfeed)
#+end_src

** Custom key bindings

The *annotate* function works in both search and show modes while
the *export* function works only in search mode.  The keys in
the =elfeed-search-mode-map= and =elfeed-show-mode-map= maps can
be bound as shown here:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package elfeed-curate
  :ensure
  :bind (:map elfeed-search-mode-map
              ("a" . elfeed-curate-edit-entry-annoation)
              ("x" . elfeed-curate-export-entries))
        (:map elfeed-show-mode-map
              ("a" . elfeed-curate-edit-entry-annoation)
              ("m" . elfeed-curate-toggle-star)
              ("q" . kill-buffer-and-window)))
#+end_src

** [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom]] configuration

*** =packages.el=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;...
(package! elfeed-curate)
;;...
#+end_src

*** =config.el=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! elfeed
  ;; Your custom Elfeed configuration.
  ;; elfeed-curate key bindings:
  (define-key elfeed-search-mode-map "a" #'elfeed-curate-edit-entry-annoation)
  (define-key elfeed-search-mode-map "x" #'elfeed-curate-export-entries)
  (define-key elfeed-search-mode-map "m" #'elfeed-curate-toggle-star)

  (define-key elfeed-show-mode-map   "a" #'elfeed-curate-edit-entry-annoation)
  (define-key elfeed-show-mode-map   "m" #'elfeed-curate-toggle-star)
  (define-key elfeed-show-mode-map   "q" #'kill-buffer-and-window))
#+end_src
I had issues closing the show window after the annotation buffer was displayed
there. Not sure what the root cause was (is), but overriding the =q= key with
=kill-buffer-and-window= seems to have solved the problem. This needs more
investigation.


** Disclaimers

- I have only tested this with Emacs 29.1, both bare-bones and with Doom. The
  code is compatible back to Emacs 25.1 and Org/Elfeed are the only
  dependencies, so there's a good chance this will work out of the box on most
  modern systems.
- Testing of the export backends has been limited to mostly HTML and Markdown.

* Usage

** Annotation Window

Annotation edit window:
[[screenshots/elfeed-curate-ann-window.png]]

Exported annotation:

[[screenshots/elfeed-curate-ann-export.png]]

The =a= key (=elfeed-curate-edit-entry-annoation=) will display an org-mode
buffer for managing annotation content. Annotation can be added, edited, and
deleted for an entry from both the elfeed search and show windows. The
annotation tag (=ann=) will be added or removed automatically.

Most org-mode formatting will be exported properly, but may differ depending on
the export format.

Surrounding annotation text with angle brackets =< text >= allows you to
override the original entry link and author(s). Everything outside of the angle
brackets will be ignored. This is handy for adding an arbitrary link that is not
currently in your feed list. The entry tags remain unchanged so you can decide
which group(s) the entry should be in. A link override example would typically
look like this:

<[[http://link_url][Link Name]] (Author Name) =Interesting stuff.=>

The following key combinations are used to exit the annotation buffer:

| Keys      | Action | Notes                                                                                       |
|-----------+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =C-c C-c= | Save   | Saves the annotation content. If the annotation buffer is empty, the annotation is removed. |
| =C-c C-d= | Delete | Delete the annotation content.                                                              |
| =C-c C-k= | Abort  | Exit the annotation buffer without saving changes.                                          |

** Export Behavior

The =x= key (=elfeed-curate-export-entries=) takes the following actions:

1. All displayed or selected search entries are grouped based on their *subject matter* tagging.
   * Tags are converted to group headings by replacing =_= characters with a
     space and capitalizing all words. E.g. the =med_dev= tag becomes "Med Dev".
   * Tags to be excluded from the subject categories are specified in
     =elfeed-curate-group-exclude-tag-list=. Non-subject group tags should be
     added to this list.
   * If one or more authors are available from the feed, they will be listed
     next to the link in parentheses: (Author 1, Author 2, ...).
   * An entry will only be displayed in one group. If the entry is in multiple
     groups, the other groups will be shown in bold brackets (*[Group 2, Group
     3,...]*) next to the exported link.
   * Use =elfeed-curate-no-group-tag= to determine how entries that do not
     belong to any group are treated. I.e. there are no tags left after removing
     the excluded list tags (above). By default, they are added to the "No
     Category" group. Set to nil to not display these entries.
   * By default, the count of each group is included in the group heading. If a
     prefix argument is used before the export (=C-u x=), the count will not be
     shown. The count can be permanently removed by setting
     =elfeed-curate-show-group-count= to =nil=.
2. The grouped content is exported to an =org= file (*export.org* in the
   =elfeed-curate-export-dir= directory).
   * Use =elfeed-curate-org-options= to specify custom org file options.
   * The =elfeed-curate-org-content-header-function= can be used to customize
     all org file header content.
3. The =export.org= file is then converted to the desired export format
   specified by =elfeed-curate-org-export-backend=. A date-stamped export file
   with the selected backend extension (=.md=, =.html=, etc.) is created.
4. The exported content is then displayed.
   * If the format is Markdown (=md=) and =elfeed-curate-hugo-base-dir= is
     specified the exported date-stamped Markdown file is written to the specified content
     section (=elfeed-curate-hugo-section=). The Hugo development server will
     automatically detect the change and display the new content.
   * In all other cases, the exported content will attempt to be displayed via
     =elfeed-curate--open-in-external-app= (=xdg-open= in most cases).

* Customization

Here are the variables that can be customized:

| Variable                                    | Default                                                                    | Desc.                                                                                                                                                         |
